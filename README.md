This "Landing Page" project is a culmination of all the HTML and CSS I have learned so far in The Odin Project's 'Foundations' course.
The aim is to design a "real" homepage/landing page which looks like something an online business might have when you first open their website link. To achieve this, I have used a combination of HTML and CSS, with particular emphasis on Flexbox to design and arrange the webpage according to the specifications laid out in the assignment.
I have done a bit of research to make a landing page which looks modern and responsive, sticking to the assignment's main parameters, but also adding a bit of personal flair to make the website unique.
